s.print.log "Environment is OK"
s.print.password
```

## üîí Security

**smack** takes security seriously:

- **Database operations**: All database functions use `MYSQL_PWD` environment variable to prevent password exposure in process lists
- **SQL injection prevention**: New `s.db.sanitize?` function validates all database-related inputs (usernames, database names, hostnames, grants)
- **YAML parsing**: Input validation prevents code injection through malicious YAML files
- **Email**: Subject lines are sanitized to prevent command injection
- **Slack**: Webhook URLs are validated, timeouts prevent hanging, and proper JSON escaping is applied
- **MySQL 8.0+ compatible**: Uses `ALTER USER` instead of deprecated `PASSWORD()` function

## ü§ù Contributing

Pull requests and issues are welcome!  
Make sure to run `shellcheck` and keep functions portable.

When contributing:
- Validate all user inputs
- Use proper quoting to prevent word splitting
- Avoid exposing sensitive data in process lists or logs
- Add comments explaining security considerations
